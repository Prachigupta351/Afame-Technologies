Eliminating Superfluous Columns: The dataset was reduced in size by eliminating columns that were judged superfluous for examination.
Renaming columns: For consistency and clarity, more standardized and descriptive names were given to the columns.
Removing Superfluous Entries: Duplicate entries were found and removed to preserve the accuracy and integrity of the data.
Sanitizing Particular Columns: Made specific formatting changes or deleted sensitive data from a few selected columns.
Managing NaN Values: NaN or missing values in the dataset were either eliminated or filled in with the proper values.
Additional Modifications: Made additional modifications to improve the dataset's usability or satisfy certain analytical needs.
Also added is the cleaned file.
Every project point is completed successfully and efficiently.
